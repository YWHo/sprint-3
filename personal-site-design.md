# Sprint-3 Redesign Your Site

## What is your site's primary purpose?
The purpose of the site is to share my learning while joining EDA bootcam.p

## Who is your target audience?
My target audience is my learning peers and anyone who are curious about what I have learnt or did while in the EDA bootcamp

## How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
Since the site is mostly for reading, the graphical usage should be at minimum to avoid causing distraction to whoever reading the pages. The visitors may visit the sites using different devices. Some may use very small screen size devices. So, the site should be responsive to the screen sizes. The visitors may use gesture to touch the links to navigate the pages, so the buttons or links need to be big enough for users' finger gestures. 

## How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
The minimumlist design is already in place. What is missing, is the responsive layout. I will use the grid system for CSS and also media query to achieve the purpose of having responsive layout. For testing, I will change the browser size to test the resposiveness. Once the responsiveness is in place, I will use real devies (phone, tablets) to test if the fonts are readable, or the buttons and links are touchable.
